## Description
This is a Next.js web application that uses the NASA Tech Transfer API to display information about patents related to NASA technologies. The user can access the information in the form of cards containing an image, a title, and a description of each patent.


## Tools
The application has been styled with Material-UI and includes a link to another page named "Polychromatic". The project retrieves data from the API using Axios, and the data is stored in the local state using React's useState hook. The useEffect hook is used to fetch data on component mount.
